# Fingerprint Matcher

This project utilizes advanced computer vision techniques to compare fingerprint images. It focuses on accurately detecting and matching keypoints in two fingerprint images, providing a robust solution for fingerprint comparison.

## Features
- **Feature Detection using SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform):**
  The project uses SIFT to extract distinctive keypoints and descriptors from fingerprint images. SIFT is highly effective in detecting scale and rotation-invariant features.

- **Efficient Matching with FLANN (Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors):**
  FLANN is used for fast and efficient matching of keypoint descriptors. It significantly speeds up the matching process, especially for large datasets.

- **Ratio Test for High-Quality Matches:**
  To ensure that only the most reliable matches are considered, the ratio test is applied. This step filters out ambiguous matches and improves overall accuracy.

- **Visualization of Keypoint Correspondences:**
  The best matches between two fingerprint images are displayed with lines connecting corresponding keypoints, providing a clear visual representation of the match.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless numpy
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>
   ```
2. Prepare the fingerprint images to be compared and place them in the `images` folder.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python fingerprint_matcher.py
   ```
4. The script will display the matching result with visualized keypoint correspondences.

## How It Works
1. **Image Input:**
   The user provides two fingerprint images.
2. **Feature Extraction:**
   SIFT is applied to both images to extract keypoints and their descriptors.
3. **Descriptor Matching:**
   FLANN matcher is used to find the best matches between the descriptors.
4. **Filtering Matches:**
   The ratio test is applied to eliminate weak matches.
5. **Result Visualization:**
   The matched keypoints are displayed with lines indicating correspondences.

## Example Output
The output of the script shows two fingerprint images side by side, with lines connecting matched keypoints, allowing for easy verification of the matching process.

## Applications
This project can be used in various domains, including:
- Biometric authentication systems
- Forensic analysis
- Security and access control

## Future Enhancements
- Adding support for other feature detectors like ORB and SURF.
- Improving the visualization by highlighting only the strongest matches.
- Extending the project to handle large-scale fingerprint databases.
